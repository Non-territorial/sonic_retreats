The actual location matters the most. Followed by architecture, acoustics, and the combination of those details.\n\nSometimes it’s a humble mountain house, sometimes it’s a contemporary villa on the seaside, ex-monastery, or resort of some kind. What matters, is the character of the place, and its transformative qualities."
